### React starter

This is a very minimal react web app meant to get you started quickly. This app includes react(obviously), webpack and babel config you can access easily and redux. It is also deployment ready.

This app itself has all the documentation you will need. However you will need to get it running in order to access that docuementation. The steps to do that are as follows: 

1. First clone this repo.
2. Open a terminal.
3. In the terminal `cd` into the directory of the cloned repo.
4. Run `npm install` from the terminal.
5. After that finishes run `npm run start:dev` (the default port is 8080).
6. Navigate to port 8080 running on your localhost and follow the instructions from there.
